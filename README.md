Step 3. Press the BIOS setup key(s). Again, that's documented for American Megatrends firmware in "American Megatrends BIOS".

Step 4. If you're in BIOS setup, go into the boot settings, change the boot order to have the tool first, save, reboot, and skip step 5. I won't document that as the process is different for different models.
